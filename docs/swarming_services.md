Certainly! Here's how you can deploy your services individually to the same stack, separating them by repository:

1. Create separate repositories for each service:
   - `cda-minio-control`: Repository for the main application service.
   - `cda-minio`: Repository for the MinIO service.

2. In each repository, create a `docker-compose.yml` file specific to that service.

   For the `cda-minio-control` repository:
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'

   services:
     web:
       image: ghcr.io/cdaprod/cda-minio-control:latest
       environment:
         - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
         - MINIO_ENDPOINT=${MINIO_ENDPOINT}
         - MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=${MINIO_ACCESS_KEY}
         - MINIO_SECRET_KEY=${MINIO_SECRET_KEY}
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       deploy:
         replicas: 3
         update_config:
           parallelism: 2
           delay: 10s
         restart_policy:
           condition: on-failure
   ```

   For the `cda-minio` repository:
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'

   services:
     minio:
       image: minio/minio:latest
       command: server /data --console-address ":9001"
       environment:
         - MINIO_ROOT_USER=${MINIO_ACCESS_KEY}
         - MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=${MINIO_SECRET_KEY}
       ports:
         - "9000:9000"
         - "9001:9001"
       volumes:
         - minio_data:/data
       deploy:
         replicas: 1
         restart_policy:
           condition: on-failure

   volumes:
     minio_data:
   ```

3. Set up GitHub Actions workflows in each repository to build and push the Docker images to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

4. In your Docker Swarm environment, set the required environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `MINIO_ENDPOINT`, `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`, `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`) that will be used by the services.

5. Deploy each service to the same stack using the `docker stack deploy` command:

   For the `cda-minio-control` service:
   ```
   docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml --with-registry-auth cda-stack
   ```

   For the `cda-minio` service:
   ```
   docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml --with-registry-auth cda-stack
   ```

   Note: The `--with-registry-auth` flag is used to pass the registry authentication details to the Swarm nodes.

6. Docker Swarm will deploy the services to the same stack (`cda-stack` in this example) based on the configurations defined in the respective `docker-compose.yml` files.

7. Access your application using the appropriate URL and port (e.g., `http://your-swarm-node:8000`).

By separating the services into different repositories and deploying them individually to the same stack, you can maintain a cleaner separation of concerns and have more flexibility in managing and updating each service independently.

Remember to set up the necessary GitHub Actions workflows in each repository to automate the image building and pushing process.
